    "##1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012, an opt-in, web-based (and mobile-enabled) collaboration network was launched at my organization, a 90,000-employee federal agency.  To date, this tool is the only one of its kind that spans across the entire agency.  While initial roll-out and user adoption were impressive (50 percent of users joined in the first 6 months), the growth rate of the network has slowed.  Among chief complaints from users is a high number of unresponded \"messages\" or posts.  Without active collaboration, the network--which is designed to foster the breaking down of organizational silos and link a geographically distributed workforce--will become a shell of its former self. To prevent such an outcome, my colleagues and I are interested in launching user engagement campaign to \"lift\" user engagement.  Rather than innundating users and potential users with mass marketing, we would like to engage users in an informed way.  "

    "1. Message content and metadata have intrinsic value in predicting user engagement\n",
